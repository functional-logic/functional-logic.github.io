======================================================================

Welcome to the 18th International Symposium on Functional and Logic
Programming (FLOPS 2026) on May 26-May 28, 2026 in Tsukuba, Japan.

FLOPS 2026 is co-sponsored by Special Interest Group on Programming
and Programming Languages (SIG-PPL), Japan Society for Software
Science and Technology (JSSST), in cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN.

FLOPS brings together practitioners, researchers and implementers of
declarative programming, to discuss mutually interesting results and
common problems: theoretical advances, their implementations in
language systems and tools, and applications of these systems in
practice. FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization
between theory and practice and among different styles of declarative
programming.

VENUE

FLOPS 2026 will take place at the University of Tskukuba.  Tsukuba is
about 60km from central Tokyo, and easily reachable via public
transport from both Haneda and Narita airports.

Tsukuba is as Japan's science and technology city.  Yet, it preserves
its rich traditions and local heritage with attractions such as
Mt. Tsukuba and Tsukubasan Shrine.
