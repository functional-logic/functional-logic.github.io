## About FLOPS

FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and
implementers of declarative programming, to discuss mutually
interesting results and common problems: theoretical advances, their
implementations in language systems and tools, and applications of
these systems in practice. The scope includes all aspects of the
design, semantics, theory, applications, implementations, and teaching
of declarative programming. FLOPS specifically aims to promote
cross-fertilization between theory and practice and among different
styles of declarative programming.
