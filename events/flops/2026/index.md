Welcome to the website of the 18th International Symposium on
Functional and Logic Programming (FLOPS 2026) on May 26-May 28, 2026
in Akita, Japan.

FLOPS 2026 is
co-sponsored by Special Interest Group on Programming and Programming
Languages (SIG-PPL), Japan Society for Software Science and Technology
(JSSST), in cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN.

## Call for Papers

The [Call for Papers](cfp/) is open.  Deadlines are Dec 8, 2025 for
abstracts and Dec 16, 2026 for papers.

## About FLOPS

FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and
implementers of declarative programming, to discuss mutually
interesting results and common problems: theoretical advances, their
implementations in language systems and tools, and applications of
these systems in practice. The scope includes all aspects of the
design, semantics, theory, applications, implementations, and teaching
of declarative programming. FLOPS specifically aims to promote
cross-fertilization between theory and practice and among different
styles of declarative programming.

Previous FLOPS meetings were held at Fuji Susono (1995), Shonan
