Tsukuba has many affordable hotels (the fees are much less than the hotels in Tokyo).
Participants of FLOPS 2026 are encouraged to book hotels by themselves. 

Notice: the local organizers will try to book several rooms in the university's guesthouse
for the participants of FLOPS 2026.
The guesthouse offers single rooms with very reasonable price (around 5000 JPY per night).
The results will be available on this page in early March.
