Tsukuba has many affordable and reasonable hotels (compared with Tokyo), and
participants are encouraged to book hotels by themselves. (There are no conference hotels.)

Notice: the local organizers are trying to book several rooms in the university's guesthouse,
and offer them to the speakers and other participants of FLOPS 2026.
The results will be available on this page in early March.
