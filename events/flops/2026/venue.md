## Venue

FLOPS 2026 will be held in 
the "Laboratory of Advanced Research B" building
at the
[University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/),
Tsukuba, Japan.  

Tsukuba is located about 50 kilometers from the center of Tokyo. The most convenient way to reach the venue is to first go to Tsukuba Station (also known as Tsukuba Center), then take a local bus to the University of Tsukuba. You can use a [Suica card](https://www.jreast.co.jp/en/multi/suica/) to pay for most public transportation in Japan.

## Reaching Japan

The nearest international airports are Tokyo/Narita and Tokyo/Haneda. You can reach Tsukuba within two hours
by public transportation (train or bus) from these airports.

If you plan to go sightseeing in Kyoto/Osaka, you may also consider using Osaka/Kansai Airport.

## Getting to Tsukuba by Bus

There are direct bus connections from Tokyo/Narita Airport, Tokyo/Haneda Airport, and Tokyo Station
to Tsukuba Center.

| Departure      | Destination                               | Time     | Fare      |
|:--------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|:--------:|:---------:|
| Tokyo/Narita Airport | Tsukuba Center                            | 1h       | 2400 JPY  |
| Tokyo/Haneda Airport | Tsukuba Center                            | 2h       | 2000 JPY  |
| Tokyo Station  | Tsukuba Center <br> University of Tsukuba | 1h 20min | 1260 JPY  |

For attendees arriving at either airport, limousine buses bound for Tsukuba Center are available from both Narita Airport and Haneda Airport. Tickets can only be purchased on the day of travel by cash or Suica card. Note that you must purchase a ticket at the counter/machine; you cannot tap your Suica card directly on the bus in this case. For more departure details, refer to the [Timetable](https://www.chibakotsu.co.jp/en/kousoku/pdf/tm_natts.pdf?241001) and [Official webpage for Tokyo/Narita Airport](https://www.chibakotsu.co.jp/en/kousoku/natts.html), or the [Timetable](https://www.kantetsu.co.jp/cms/wp-content/themes/kr/pdf/bus/2023111infohaneda.pdf) and [Official webpage for Tokyo/Haneda Airport](https://www.kantetsu.co.jp/en/lang/expressbus/tsukuba-hnd).

For attendees arriving at Tokyo Station by train, there is a limousine bus bound for Tsukuba Center (refer to the [Timetable (in Japanese only)](https://www.kantetsu.co.jp/cms/wp-content/themes/kr/pdf/bus/hw_time_tsukuba-tokyo.pdf) and [Official webpage](https://www.kantetsu.co.jp/en/lang/expressbus/tsukuba-tokyo)). You can purchase tickets and board the express bus at the [JR Expressway Bus Service counter](https://www.tokyostationcity.com/en/information/bus_taxi.html) near the Yaesu South Gate of Tokyo Station. Alternatively, you can use a Suica card to board directly without purchasing a ticket in advance.

## Reaching Tsukuba by Train

You can take trains from the airports to reach Tsukuba, but you will need to transfer several times. The [Tsukuba Express (TX)](https://www.mir.co.jp/en/) train line connects Akihabara Station (in central Tokyo) to Tsukuba Station in 45 minutes (a rapid train) or 54 minutes (a semi-rapid train). Use an Internet search to find the best route from your departure place.
You only have to tap your Suica card at the ticket gates to board a train. Refer to the [Station Information](https://www.mir.co.jp/en/howto/route_map/) for details.

## Getting to the campus

Tsukuba Center is the bus pool just above Tsukuba Station; use the escalator or elevator to reach it.

Local buses take you from Tsukuba Center to the campus. The nearest bus stop to the venue is "Dai-Ichi Area Mae".

| Departure      | Destination        | Time     | Fare      |
|:--------------:|:---------------------:|:-------------:|:----:|
| Tsukuba Center | Dai-Ichi Area Mae | 10min ~ 20min | 310 JPY |

At Tsukuba Center, find the No.6 Bus Stop.
Take the "Tsukuba-Daigaku-Junkan" (Univ. Tsukuba loop line) bus ([map of Tsukuba Center, in Japanese only](https://kantetsu.jorudan.biz/?p=d&m=a&b1=%E3%81%A4%E3%81%8F%E3%81%B0%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC&v)). Refer to the [timetable](https://www.kantetsu.co.jp/cms/wp-content/themes/kr/pdf/bus/timetable_files/center/center06.pdf) for departure times from Tsukuba Center and the [map](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/about/campus-access/tsukuba-access/campusbus_route_en.pdf) for the bus route.

Board the bus through the rear door and exit through the front door. Attendees using a Suica card must tap it on the sensor next to the door when boarding and getting off the bus. Alternatively, attendees paying in cash must take a ticket upon boarding and pay the fare upon exiting. Refer to the "How to get on and off the bus" section in [this guide](https://www.kantetsu.co.jp/en/lang/bus/guide) for detailed instructions.

IMPORTANT: you should ring the bell on the bus to let the driver stop at the next stop.
(The bus stop before "Dai-Ichi Area Mae" is "Daigaku Kaikan" or "Dai-San Area Mae", depending on your bus.)

You can also use a taxi from Tsukuba Center to the venue. 

## Building for FLOPS 2026
